        <p>I have a hard time thinking of really any instance where I would have been affected by stereotype threat. As a white man I'm not really aware of negative stereotypes about me that would have impacted my performance academically. I'm a huge nerd which has probably affected my social life some, but I doubt that it stereotype threat would have had an impact that wouldn't have been overshadowed simply by my preferences in activities, or general anxiety about doing things outside of my comfort zone. Besides that nerdiness has been seen increasingly more acceptable and cool in the past decade, and while some negative stereotypes persist they are growing increasingly outdated.</p>
        <p>I don't really know what else I can reasonably say on this topic. I was going to go into the impostor syndrome that I suffered from in college but after writing about it they don't really seem like the same things, and it felt kind of wrong to try to link the two. Impostor syndrome seems to be worrying about what other people would think of you once they discover that you're not as smart/good/whatever as they think you are. Stereotype threat seems to be anxiety related to the knowledge that a specific stereotype doesn't apply to you but that you're going to mess up and validate people's shitty opinions anyway.</p>
        <p>I'm not fully on board with the idea of stereotype threat, mainly because it has shown to be very difficult to reproduce and meta reviews of the literature have shown that the effect is much smaller than the original study found. However, just because I haven't experienced something in my life doesn't mean that my experiences generalize to humanity, so its something to keep in mind when working with people at DBC.</p>
