        <p>I think the value that most resonated with me would be valuing close relationships/friendships. Friendships are pretty important to me since I tend to get social anxiety. It wasn't really easy for me to make friends before college so I've tended to value my friends highly. I've also really valued the communities that I choose to be a part of because I've found it comforting to be a part of a community that I identify with.</p>
        <p>I feel like these values will mesh pretty well at DBC. Spending a lot of time working with a group of people is a pretty good way to get to know them, and it seems to me like DBC tries to foster a good sense of community so I think I'll be pretty comfortable there. My last cultural blog talked more about stereotype threat and how I don't think I'm very likely to suffer from it, but even so a welcoming community would go a long way to combating that in anyone. I'm going to be doing my part by trying to be a good member of the DBC community and learning as much as possible while I'm there. </p>
