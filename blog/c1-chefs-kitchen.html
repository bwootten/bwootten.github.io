      	Shereef's taching philosophy is kind of what I expected DBC to be about, where students are responsible for taking control of their own learning, at least to some extent. That kind of philosophy is something I had to adopt as an undergrad. I studied physics and that isn't something you can just passively stand by and absorb because you're not going to get it the first time you learn something in lecture. I've been used to working with my classmates to finish difficult homeworks, or to understand material so I'm glad that that kind of thing is also expected at DBC.
