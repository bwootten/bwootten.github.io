<p>When I was first starting my graduate research I was working with an undergrad, we'll call him Miles, who had been working on the same project for a couple months before I started in the lab. Basically what we were trying to do was measure light emitting out of really tiny laser diodes (their size was on the order of millimeters). To do this we had to use a pair of concave mirrors to focus as much light as possible into our detectors, but since it wasn't emitting enough to be really visible getting the alignment right was very difficult. We had some tools to help us, but was sometimes taking hours to get the alignment right, which was compounded by our inability to even know if the chips were working.  Really there was no reason for this to be a two person job, except I was still unfamiliar with the lab setup and the research overall and Miles was.</p>

<p>This eventually led to a pretty frustrating afternoon, we hadn't collected much data in the past week and the data we had collected wasn't great. After far too long of trying to align our mirrors correctly Miles and I ended up in a pretty heated argument. I felt like we were wasting too much time with trying to align things, and needed to figure out better ways to align them, Miles thought we should stay the course. We were both very frustrated at the lab setup and how we weren't making progress. Fortunately, it was near the end of the day anyway so we were able to go home and have a more reasoned discussion the next day, eventually deciding on experimenting with different methods to take data. </p>

<p>If I could go back and change anything I would probably have forced the issue much sooner before we had wasted so much time on ineffectual methods. I didn't at the time because I was new, and didn't want to rock the boat too much but I thought the way we were doing things wasn't good to begin with. The main thing I take away from thinking back on that situation was that I should probably be more vocal about my thoughts and opinions.</p>
