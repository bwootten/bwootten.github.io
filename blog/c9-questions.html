        <p>I have a terrible memory, so I took some time to look at some of the top questions on stack overflow as well as some of the questions what had been unanswered for a couple of days. What I found mainly confirmed what I thought I was going to find; good questions get answered because they are easy to answer. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that their content is easy to understand, or to explain, merely that they minimize the amount of work the answerer has to do in order to answer the question.</p>
<p>Good questions get to the point quickly (on stack overflow this means writing a descriptive title) but  then provide as much context as is helpful. Context is important since its often that my initial question isn't really what I want to know about, when pairing for the DOM manipulation challenge this week my pair and I got really stuck on release 5. If I had just asked the initial question (“Why isn't .appendChild working?”) I couldn't have gotten a useful answer, since that isn't even what was wrong. The problem in our code was back in release 4, which looked like it was working but instead was crashing our script file.</p>

<p>If you're asking about a bug you should include a code sample, the behavior you expect and what is actually happening. Questions that are about knowledge gathering should include the context of what is motivating the question in the first place; it might turn out that you're pointed in the exact wrong direction for your situation. </p>

<p>Basically you want people to be able to answer your question without needing to ask you any questions in return. Any extra work your answerer has to do to understand your problem will make it less likely to get an answer (on the Internet at least) or make it more likely you'll get a wrong or misleading answer. You want your question to quickly sum up your problem and prevent any miscommunication so that the question being answered is the same as the one being asked.</p>
