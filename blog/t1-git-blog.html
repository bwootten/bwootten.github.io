      Software development is an iterative process, and many programs are collaborated on by many people. Because of this it's very important (and useful) to keep track of all the changes done to the project, that's where version control comes in. Version control is keeping a log of all the changes done to the project so its easier to integrate everyone's changes into a working program, as well as make it easier to undo changes that turn out to be harmful, or unnecessary.

        There are a couple programs out there that help programmers impliment version control in their projects, Git is one of them. Git lets you keep multiple "branches" of your project, for instance a master branch for finalized changes and a development branch for actually working on the project. It tracks each branch seperately and lets you compare the two branches, as well as merge branches together when you're ready to publish your new changes. One common place to store projects is the website GitHub. It serves as an online repository for code, which makes it much easier to collaborate on projects with people all over the world. By storing your master copy on GitHub everyone is able to work on the project on their local computer, publish changes to GitHub and see any changes made by anyone else as soon as they're made.
