        <p>Pairing wasn't really what I had expected coming into phase 0. I majored in physics in college, and there was a lot of collaboration on physics problems and I kind of expected pairing to be similar to that. The fact that I'm pairing with people over the Internet, not in the same room as them makes it really different though. It's harder to get my point across, and I feel like its harder to explain my ideas(and also harder to understand my pair's) since I'm such a hands on, visual learner. That has made it a bit frustrating, but I also enjoy it for the reasons I enjoyed working in groups in college. Collaborating on something means other people are going to bring out their own ideas to the group, and you're going to discover alternative methods to solve problems much faster than on your own. Overall its been good, especially when I've gotten to just discuss the problems with people and look at how they've been doing things to get a different perspective than my own.</p>
        <p>Feedback has been a lot harder. I'm the guy who always turned in blank feedback papers in college since it was never something I really thought about during the class. Its something I'm needing to train myself to consciously think about because unless there's something that really obviously needs improvement I don't remember it when its time to give feedback. This has led to a lot of my given feedbacks to not really have anything actionable in them, because I simply didn't notice anything.</p>
        <p>Receiving feedback is also something that I haven't been good at. I'm fine with it when its verbal and I'm able to talk to the person giving it, but for whatever reason written feedback is always accompanied with a twinge of anxiety. This post is really the first time I've actually read my feedback (although that's partly due to not being observant enough to notice it at the bottom of the feedbackinator). Like most things people stress over it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared it might be, mainly I need to be more vocal about my ideas when pairing. Reading that was kind of weird, since  I sometimes feel like I'm being too vocal and not letting my pair share their ideas enough, but I guess I can stop worrying about that too.</p>
        <p>Overall I think that pairing, and especially GPSes, are really useful for learning the phase0 material. I've always found it easier to learn alongside other people and this hasn't been any different. </p>
