        <p>At the beginning of phase0 I took the Gregoric Thinking Style quiz, but I didn't really think about what it meant beyond reading a brief description of my result. This blog challenge <a href=”http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm”>linked here</a> which defines the four thinking quadrants much better and makes me think that my results from the quiz were pretty accurate. The quiz gave me an almost even split on the concrete/abstract axis (leaning abstract) but showed that on the sequential/random axis sequential is very dominant. </p>
        <p>The concrete/abstract axis is a measure of how one perceives things. People who are more concrete are more comfortable dealing with things that they can physically see, touch, hear, taste or smell. People who are more abstract are more comfortable dealing with things that are, well, abstract. Ideas, implications and the imaginary more so than the here and now. As I said above, I'm pretty split between the two, and I think that's pretty accurate; I don't really notice myself favoring one over the other.</p>
        <p>The sequential/abstract axis is a measure of how your mind organizes things. Sequential people tend to organize things in a linear manner. They make plans and have a hard time deviating from those plans. Abstract people organize things in relational chunks and tend to work by skipping steps here, and backtracking there instead of working beginning to end. I also feel like the quiz was right here, my process is very dominated by order and logic. I tend to have a hard time writing things, and one of the reasons why is because I have a hard time letting go of a paragraph until I feel like its perfect instead of letting myself come back later to revise it.</p>
        <p>So what does being concrete/abstract sequential mean in relation to DBC? It's helpful since I'm pretty comfortable with learning in a structured, predictable environment, which DBC (and programming in general) is. But it also means that I have a harder time going off book and exploring things for the sake of exploring them, which is a bit part of learning something new. I'm going to have to work at finishing things first, and getting them perfect second; I struggled a lot with week 2's challenge of making my webpage until I was able to force myself to be ok with how it looks now instead of what I think it could look like someday. There's going to be a lot of experiences that aren't in my specific comfort zone, but that's something I'm going to have to deal with.</p>
