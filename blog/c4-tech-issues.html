        <p>One of the big issues in the tech world that has become increasingly evident in the past decade is the need for better IT security. In the past year and a half roughly 40 million credit and debit cards were stolen when Target was hacked late 2013, and over 47,000 social security numbers were exposed when Sony was hacked November last year, and those were just the ones I remember hearing about. There were at least 20 major security breaches of large companies last year[1], as well as a breach at the state department by the Russian government [2].</p>
        <p>There are a couple reasons these breaches keep happening. Often its the cause of a hastily pushed software change, or a bug that has gone unnoticed like what was noticed in Tinder last year[3]. Tinder is a mobile dating app that matches people together in part based on their geographical location, but what was overlooked is that the stored precision on people's location was great enough to pinpoint them within 100 feet. </p>
        <p>Another way hackers are getting access to personal information is through phishing[4]; in fact this is how the attacks on Target and the US state department were started. Phishing is essentially a scam where e-mails are sent en-mass with the hope that one of the recipients will be careless enough to click a link, or open an attached file (or even respond with their username or password). These attacks work because there really isn't that much information required to break into a bank or work account, usually just some username or email plus a password is required.</p>
        <p>It's also probable that IT security isn't yet as high a priority as it needs to be to stop these attacks. Diverting development resources to work on security, or hiring out a third-party costs money that doesn't have a visible return. Security is preventative, so even if you can tell when you've prevented an attack you still can't be sure how much damage it would have done, which has probably made IT security spending a hard sell in the past. Also, even if your company has an impenetrable security system you can still be the victim of an attacker exploiting bugs, or phishing one of your employees.</p>
        <p>I can only really guess at solutions to this problem without quite a bit more research, but it seems to me that a lot of attention needs to be spent on the human aspect of security. One thing which I think needs to be more widely adopted is two-factor authorization. What this does is it essentially gives, for example, your email account two passwords. One of them you type in whenever you want to access your email, and the second one is a random string that is texted to your phone when you try to login from a location or device that you haven't authorized. This prevents hackers from accessing your email without also hacking or stealing your phone. Phishers would have a harder time getting into your accounts because they could really only phish half of your passwords. </p>
